# To-Do-List-API
This project is a To-Do List application built using Django Rest Framework (DRF) with full CRUD functionality and JWT-based authentication. Key features include:
# Comprehensive API:  
The application is designed with DRF to handle full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for to-do items, ensuring robust management of tasks.

# JWT Authentication: 
Secure user authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), allowing users to register, log in, and manage their to-do items while ensuring session security.

# PostgreSQL Database: 
The application leverages PostgreSQL as its database, providing reliable and efficient data storage and retrieval.

# Swagger Integration: 
For better API documentation and ease of interaction during development and testing, Swagger UI is integrated. This allows developers and users to explore the API endpoints interactively.

# Dockerized Deployment: 
The application is containerized using Docker, ensuring a consistent development and production environment. Docker simplifies the setup process and enhances portability across different systems.

# Git for Version Control: 
Version control is managed with Git, enabling efficient tracking of changes, collaboration, and code management across the development lifecycle.

This combination of technologies ensures a scalable, secure, and well-documented To-Do List app that can be easily deployed and maintained.
